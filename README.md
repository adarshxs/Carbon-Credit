# Carbon-Credit

A decentralized application (dApp) that rewards users for producing energy via renewable sources (eg. solar panels). The dApp uses sensors or other monitoring devices to track the output of each user's renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines and stores this data in a decentralized database. Users can earn credits or tokens by contributing energy to the grid, and can track their energy production and rewards using the dApp's user interface. The dApp could be used by renewable energy companies or other organizations looking to promote the adoption of renewable energy technologies.
